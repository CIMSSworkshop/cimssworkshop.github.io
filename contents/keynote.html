				<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Additive manufacturing (AM), also called 3D printing, is revolutionizing fields as diverse as aerospace, automobile, medical implants and devices, and archeology. The AM process chain makes extensive use of computers and cloud based resources from product design stage to final printing of the part using a 3D printer. Such a process chain is vulnerable to cyberattacks, which presents numerous challenges for quality assurance, intellectual property protection, and product authentication. Cybersecurity methods such as computer and network security, file encryption and password protection are used for making the AM process chain secure. However, breaches to even the most secure computer and network assets have been reported. A novel design based methodology is developed in the present work where features are embedded in the design files that allow printing of files in high quality only under a specific set of predetermined conditions. These methods are used for developing secure designs and product authentication methods in the AM process chain. Examples are shown where obfuscated design features make on-screen visualization of the part different from the printed part and a scheme to embed a code for product authentication. These new methods provide a second layer of security rooted in product design and can be applied in addition to the cybersecurity methods.</p>
