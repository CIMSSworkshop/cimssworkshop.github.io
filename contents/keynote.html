					<h3>Do not attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompentence</h3>
					<p>Dieter Gollmann</p>
				</div>


				<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
				There was a time when it was hard to find a paper on the formal analysis of security protocols that did not tell the reader that designing security protocols is difficult and error prone. After a while, it was observed that in fact a few basic mistakes were being repeated. Today, it is generally accepted that the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures requires utmost attention. This talk will look at some recent power grid outages and discuss what these incidents might tell us about the resilience of critical infrastructures and whether we are looking in the right direction in research on the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures.

				<p><strong>Bio:</strong> 
				Dieter Gollmann holds a Dipl.-Ing. in Engineering Mathematics (1979) and a Dr.tech. (1984) from the University of Linz, Austria. He had moved into security with his PhD thesis on clock-controlled shift registers, had been the first Course Director of the MSc in Information Security at Royal Holloway, spent several years with Microsoft Research in Cambridge, and held the chair for Security in Distributed Applications at Hamburg University of Technology from 2003 until he retired in 2021. He has held visiting positions and taught security courses at TU Graz, Austria, at the Technical University of Denmark and at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. In the last few years, he has given on-line courses at Al-Farabi Kazakh National University.
