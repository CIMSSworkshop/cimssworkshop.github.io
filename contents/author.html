			<h3> Paper Submission </h3>
			<p> <b>  The submission portal is open. </b> <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cimss2022">Click</a></p>  
		-->
			
			<p align="justify"> Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to any other venue with formally published proceedings.  Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for that purpose. Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgement or obvious references.  Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader.  All submissions must follow the original <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank">LNCS format</a> with a page limit of <b>18</b> pages (incl. references) for the main part (reviewers are not required to read beyond this limit) and 30 pages in total. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference and must make a full version of their paper available online.  Submissions not meeting the submission guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. It is strongly encouraged that submissions be processed in <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WuA4JS5uZpi" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>.</p>
			<p> <b>Work-in-progress papers are welcome</b>, and such submissions can expectedly be less than the maximum page limit of 18 pages. Submissions less than 9 pages, however, are discouraged as there is not enough space for appropriate technical content presentation. Authors are required to include "WiP:" in the title of a work-in-progress paper submission.</p>
			<p> A <em> best paper award </em> (with $500 prize sponsored by Springer) will be selected from all workshops in conjunction with ACNS2023.</p>
			<p> <b>The accepted papers will have post-proceedings published by Springer in the LNCS series. </b></p>

			<h3> Conflict of Interest: </h3>
			<p> It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, and to e-mail the names of these PC members to the PC chairs using the contact email <a href="mailto:cimss2023@easychair.org">(cimss2023@easychair.org)</a> until the submission deadline. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection. We share the same definition of conflicts of Interest with ACNS'23. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member if and only if one or more of the following conditions holds:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> The PC member shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission; </li>
				<li> The PC member was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past; </li>
				<li> The PC member has collaborated or published with an author in the prior two years; </li>
				<li> The PC member is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds the research of an author; </li>
				<li> The PC member is a close personal friend or family member of an author.</li>
			</ol>
