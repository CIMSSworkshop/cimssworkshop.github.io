			<h3>Workshop Description</h3>
			<p align="justify">Critical Infrastructure like power grids, water supply systems, transportation systems, are the backbones of our modern life. Therefore, the security of critical infrastructures is essential for our society. However, most of the existing infrastructures are still running without sufficient security protections, and more and more of them are getting connected and exposed on the Internet. The gap between the attack surface and security measures undermines the safety of everyone relying on the infrastructures.</p>

			<p align="justify">Nowadays, with increasing numbers of manufacturing systems adopting the concept of industry 4.0, manufacturing systems are new targets for attackers to hack. Attacks on manufacturing systems can cause monetary loss of enterprises, performance degradation of the products, and production suspension, which are all serious consequences for our society and the manufacturers.</p>

			<p align="justify">This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in critical infrastructures and manufacturing systems security (CIMSS) to share new ideas. This workshop also intends to foster communications between academia and industry to discuss real-world challenges and innovative solutions.</p>
