		</ul>

		<h3>Workshop Description</h3>
		<p align="justify">Critical Infrastructure like power grids, water supply systems, transportation systems, is the backbones of our modern life. Therefore, the security of critical infrastructures is essential for our society. However, most of the existing infrastructures are still running without sufficient security protections, and more and more of them are getting connected and exposed on the Internet. The gap between the attack surface and security measures undermines the safety of everyone relying on the infrastructures.</p>

		<p align="justify">Nowadays, with increasing numbers of manufacturing systems adopting the concept of industry 4.0, manufacturing systems are new targets for attackers to hack. Attacks on manufacturing systems can cause monetary loss of enterprises, performance degradation of the products, and production suspension, which are all serious consequences for our society and the manufacturers.</p>

		<p align="justify">This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in critical infrastructures and manufacturing systems security (CIMSS) to share new ideas. This workshop also intends to foster communications between academia and industry to discuss real-world challenges and innovative solutions.</p>

		<h3> Paper Submission </h3>
		<h4>Instructions for authors: </h4> 

		<p> <b>  The submission portal will be open soon.</b> </p>

		<p align="justify"> Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to any other venue with formally published proceedings.  Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for that purpose. Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgement or obvious references.  Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader.  All submissions must follow the original <a href="http://www.springeronline.com/lncs" target="_blank">LNCS format</a> with a page limit of <b>18</b> pages (incl. references) for the main part (reviewers are not required to read beyond this limit) and 30 pages in total. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference and must make a full version of their paper available online.  Submissions not meeting the submission guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. It is strongly encouraged that submissions be processed in LaTeX.</p>
		<p> A <b style="color:red;"> best paper award </b> will be selected from all workshops in conjunction with ACNS2021.</p>
		<p> <b>The accepted papers will have post-proceedings published by Springer in the LNCS series. </b></p>
