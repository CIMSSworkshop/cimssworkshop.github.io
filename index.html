			<h3>Workshop Description</h3>
			<p align="justify">Critical Infrastructure like power grids, water supply systems, transportation systems, are the backbones of our modern life. Therefore, the security of critical infrastructures is essential for our society. However, most of the existing infrastructures are still running without sufficient security protections, and more and more of them are getting connected and exposed on the Internet. The gap between the attack surface and security measures undermines the safety of everyone relying on the infrastructures.</p>

			<p align="justify">Nowadays, with increasing numbers of manufacturing systems adopting the concept of industry 4.0, manufacturing systems are new targets for attackers to hack. Attacks on manufacturing systems can cause monetary loss of enterprises, performance degradation of the products, and production suspension, which are all serious consequences for our society and the manufacturers.</p>

			<p align="justify">This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in critical infrastructures and manufacturing systems security (CIMSS) to share new ideas. This workshop also intends to foster communications between academia and industry to discuss real-world challenges and innovative solutions.</p>

			<h3> Paper Submission </h3>
			<h4>Instructions for authors: </h4> 

			<p> <b>  The submission portal is open. <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cimss2021">Click</a></b> </p>

			<p align="justify"> Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to any other venue with formally published proceedings.  Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for that purpose. Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgement or obvious references.  Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader.  All submissions must follow the original <a href="http://www.springeronline.com/lncs" target="_blank">LNCS format</a> with a page limit of <b>18</b> pages (incl. references) for the main part (reviewers are not required to read beyond this limit) and 30 pages in total. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference and must make a full version of their paper available online.  Submissions not meeting the submission guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. It is strongly encouraged that submissions be processed in LaTeX.</p>
			<p> <b>Work-in-progress papers are welcome</b>, and such submissions can expectedly be less than the maximum page limit of 18 pages. Submissions less than 9 pages, however, are discouraged as there is not enough space for appropriate technical content presentation. Authors are required to include "WiP:" in the title of a work-in-progress paper submission.</p>
			<p> A <b style="color:red;"> best paper award </b> will be selected from all workshops in conjunction with ACNS2021.</p>
			<p> <b>The accepted papers will have post-proceedings published by Springer in the LNCS series. </b></p>

			<h4> Conflict of Interest: </h4>
			<p> We share the same definition on conflicts of Interest with ACNS'21, which is based on Usenix Security’20. The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. During the submission process, we will ask authors to identify members of the program committee with whom they share a conflict of interest. This includes: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission, (2) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past, (3) anyone the author has collaborated or published with in the prior two years, (4) anyone who is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds your research, or (5) close personal friendships. For other forms of conflict, authors must contact the chairs and explain the perceived conflict. Program committee members who are in conflict of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of the paper by default. </P>
